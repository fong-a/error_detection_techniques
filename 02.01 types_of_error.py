# This brief class will consider the different data types of error a developer can experience
# These include:
#       1 syntax errors
#       2 runtime errors
#       3 logic errors

# 1 Syntax Errors

# myfunction(x, y):
#     return x + y

# else:
#     print("Hello!")

# if mark >= 50
#     print("You passed!")

# if arriving:
#     print("Hi!")
# esle:
#     print("Bye!")

# if flag:
# print("Flag is set!")


# 2 Runtime Errors
#  Some examples of runtime errors:

    #   division by zero
    #   performing an operation on incompatible types
    #   using an identifier which has not been defined
    #   accessing a list element, dictionary value or object attribute which doesn’t exist
    #   trying to access a file which doesn’t exist

# x = 5/0
# print(x)
# print("Lachlan" * "Golden")
# print(name)
# nums = [1,2,3,5,6,7657,4324]
# print(nums[7])


# 3 Logic Errors
# Python logic errors: TryIt

# width = int(input("Please enter the width of a rectangle"))
# height = int(input("Please enter the height of a rectangle"))

# area = width * height
# print("The area of the rectangle is " + str(area))

# perimeter = width + width + height
# print("The perimeter of the rectangle is " + str(area))

# if width != height:
#   print("Your rectangle is a square")
